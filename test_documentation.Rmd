## R Markdown

The data for this project come from ....


The statistical model we used to estimate our predictions is this:

```{r cars}
y <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
